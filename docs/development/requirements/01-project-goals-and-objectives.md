2. **Increase Political Transparency**: Make government plans more accessible and understandable to the general public
3. **Support Research & Journalism**: Provide tools for journalists and political analysts to conduct deep comparative analysis
4. **Demonstrate RAG Technology**: Serve as a reference implementation for testing different LLM providers, vector databases, and RAG pipelines

## Target Audience

1. **General Voters/Citizens** - Costa Rican citizens researching candidates before elections
2. **Journalists & Researchers** - Media professionals analyzing and reporting on political proposals
3. **Political Analysts** - Professionals conducting deep comparative analysis of government plans

2. **Fast Development** - Launch quickly to be relevant for the election cycle
3. **High Accuracy** - Ensure answer quality and proper source attribution
4. **Future Scalability** - Design architecture to handle growth and high traffic during peak election periods

## Success Metrics

- Users can successfully compare proposals across parties
- Answers are grounded in official PDF sources with proper citations
