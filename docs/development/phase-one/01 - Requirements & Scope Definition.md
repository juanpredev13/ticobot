## Description

Define the complete requirements and scope for the TicoBot RAG system. This includes:
- Project goals and objectives
- Core features and capabilities
- Data sources and processing requirements
- Provider flexibility requirements
- System boundaries and constraints

## Why?

Establishing clear requirements and scope ensures:
- All stakeholders understand what the system will do
- Development stays focused and avoids scope creep
- Technical decisions align with project goals
- Resource allocation is appropriate

- [ ] Documented project goals
- [ ] List of core features and capabilities
- [ ] Data source specifications (TSE 2026 government plans)
- [ ] Provider abstraction requirements
- [ ] System boundaries and limitations
- [ ] Success criteria definition
